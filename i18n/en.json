		"description": "This system is a kind of \"lexico-semantic search engine\". Given a text query it provides a list of related words. A traditional search engine provides as a results a list of related documents. The current version is based on two semantic similarity measures -- Serelex and PatternSim. The first relies on definitions of words, while the second relies on a text corpus. This is an ongoing project, please write your suggestions or comments to Alexander Panchenko (alexander.panchenko@uclouvain.be)",
